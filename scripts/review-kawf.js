It will put you in a sea of questions Some of them you will find their answers between the lines, and some of them you will never be able to find their answers as long as you live..The most beautiful novel I have read."

        comment:"The first reason I read this novel is because it is in great demand among Arab readers, and he is also a famous writer, and his novels have a high price and are available in all bookstores. The most important question is, is this novel worth the hype? The answer is, it is not worth a single riyal. I tried and forced myself to read it."

        comment:"I read Khawf, and I must say that it is really, really and completely wonderful. I have always been attracted to the worlds of the jinn, and to be honest with you, I am not good with Arabic novels for several reasons, so the release of Khawf changed many things and went outside our box of expectations."

        comment:"Shedding light on the power of women, whether they are human or devilish... mercy or torment. His depiction of the relationship between the pound and the human being... seemed to me to be true and not exaggerated or imaginary, unlike other novels of this kind. The strength of a friendship relationship ."

        comment:"I rate the book with four stars. The book attracts attention and excites you to learn about a world that you do not know. The world of the jinn is unknown to me. I enjoyed the book, whether it was a true story by the writer or a novel. You may feel afraid while reading it, but when you finish it‚Äù"
